<h2 align="center">Shovels</h2>
<p align="center">
    Each coconut has its own shovel that is equiped right after the game starts.<br>
    Shovels are used as a weapon to deal some damage to the opponent with each hit.<br>
    At the end of the shovel there is a collider, and a script that detects when and what enters collider.
    If hit object is player with diffrent PlayerIndex, damage is dealt and health bar is updated.
</p>

<br>
<h2 align="center">Movement</h2>
<p align="center">
    Players always face each other to make sure they can always hit each other.<br>
    Movement direction is relative to the island, camera doesn't affect players movement.<br>
    To make game a little more exciting, players can jump and use that to dodge attacks or jump over other player.
</p>

<br>
<h2 align="center">Winning</h2>
<p align="center">
    In order to win one of the players must hit other enough times with the shovel.<br>
    Or stay on the island while opponent falls into water.<br>
    When game ends, defeated player drops shovel, rolls of the island, and the winner starts dancing untill the game restarts.
